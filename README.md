# Food shop mangement System - layered architecture

The drawback of the existing system is that it is very difficult to retrieve data from case files. It is difficult to handle the whole system manually and it is less accurate and to keep the data in case files for future reference because it may get destroyed. Moreover, it is very difficult to retrieve data. Redundancy of data may occur and this may lead to the inconsistency. The manual system is so time-consuming.

The purpose of my project entitled as “Food_shop_mangement_System” is to computerize the Front Office Management of food shop and to develop software which is user friendly, simple, fast, and cost – effective. It deals with the collection of Customer information and Employee information, Order details, etc. Traditionally, it was done manually.

My system is very user friendly and written in Java and MySQL. The owner and receptionist can access the system. Owner has full access to the system he can do anything. For example, add, delete and edit Order and employees.
